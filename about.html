			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<h2>The Man Backstage</h2>
			<p>His name is Joseph Davis. He's just like you. He works a job. He goes to school for a degree. He even has a family. Yet there's something a little different about him. 
			Every time you mention a <span>disc</span>, his eyes light up a little. Whenever you inquire what <span>game</span> everyone should play, his suggestion is always one of the first heard. He spends 
			his free time honing his <span>skills</span>; countless hours have been spent going through the <span>motions</span>. This is because Joseph is a fanatic; more specifically, he is a <span>Frisbee fanatic</span>.</p>
			<h2>Why The Site?</h2>
			<p>This website is devoted to the sport that is called <span>Ultimate Frisbee</span>. To the ones who play it, it's commonly referred to as just Ultimate. For too long, Ultimate has been pushed to 
			the side when it comes time to discuss sports. That <span>time</span> has come to an <span>end</span>. It's time we give the sport the <span>respect</span> it <span>deserves</span>.</p>
