			<h1>History of Ultimate</h1>
			<h2>The Early Days</h2>
			<p>Joel Silver, along with other students, developed the sport at Columbia High School in Maplewood, New Jersey in 1968.
			Silver had learned "Frisbee Football" at a summer camp the year before and suggested that his school make a team. It was first taken as a joke, but eventually
			the first game was played a year later between the student council and newspaper staff in the high school parking lot, 
			using a Wham-O Master disc. Silver and others developed the first and second edition of "Rules of Ultimate Frisbee." In 1970 CHS
			defeated Millburn High School 43-10 in the first interscholastic game. By 1971, CHS, Millburn and three other NJ schools had made up the first
			conference of Ultimate teams.</p>
			<h2>It's Growing</h2>
			<p>Alumni of that first league took the game to their colleges and universities. In the first intercollegiate game, Rutgers
			defeated Princeton 29-27. Rutgers also won the first tournament in 1975 that featured eight other schools. That summer, the sport
			was introduced at the Second World Frisbee Championships. This introduced Ultimate to the West Coast. The popularity of the sport
			spread quickly as an alternative to traditional organized sports.</p>
			<h2>Ultimate Frisbee Today</h2>
			<p>In late 1979, the Ultimate Players Association became the first national Ultimate organization. The UPA has organized tournaments 
			and crowned a national champion every year since its inception. In 2010, the UPA rebranded itself as 
			<a href="http://www.usaultimate.org/index.html" target="_blank">USA Ultimate</a>. In 1981, the European Flying
			Disc Federation was formed. In 1984, the World Flying Disc Federation was formed by the EFDF as the international governing body for
			disc sports. The first World Championships tournament was held in 1983 in Gothenburg, Sweden.</p>
